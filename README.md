This repository shows how to easily format IFCB data that are stored in
a database, with or without manual annotation, into a format suitable to
be imported in EcoTaxa.

This is especially useful to:

1.  Import in EcoTaxa images that were manually annotated with another
    tool such as ifcb-annotate (either for validation or to use as
    training set for non annotated images)
2.  Export non-annotated images to classify them in EcoTaxa
